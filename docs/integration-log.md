- Configured environment variables for BoxyHQ services
- Set up SAML Jackson service on port 5225
- Added i18n support (next-i18next)
- Configured Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI

#### 2. Component Setup

- Added common utilities and configurations

#### 3. Authentication Flow
- Configured NextAuth.js with BoxyHQ providers
- Set up path aliases in tsconfig.json
- Added type definitions for auth components
- Created hooks for invitation handling

### Final Solution
Created a dedicated script (`scripts/jackson.js`) to properly initialize SAML Jackson:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const jackson = require('@boxyhq/saml-jackson');

async function startServer() {
  const app = express();
  const port = 5225;

  const config = {
    externalUrl: process.env.BOXYHQ_SAML_JACKSON_URL || 'http://localhost:5225',
    samlPath: '/api/v1/saml',
    db: {
      engine: 'sql',
      type: 'postgres',
      url: process.env.SAML_DATABASE_URL || 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/blueprint_club_saml?schema=public',
    },
    saml: {
      callback: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/boxyhq-saml',
    },
    oidc: {
      clientSecretVerifier: process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_VERIFIER,
    },
    apiKey: process.env.SAML_ADMIN_API_KEY,
  };

  try {
    const jacksonInstance = await jackson.default(config);
    app.use('/', jacksonInstance);

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`SAML Jackson service started on port ${port}`);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to start SAML Jackson:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

startServer();
```

### Key Configuration Notes
1. `externalUrl`: Required configuration that specifies the public URL where SAML Jackson is accessible
2. `samlPath`: Base path for SAML endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/saml/authorize`, `/api/v1/saml/metadata`)
3. `db`: PostgreSQL database configuration for storing SAML settings
4. `saml.callback`: The callback URL for the SAML authentication flow
5. `apiKey`: API key for securing admin endpoints

### Dependencies
Make sure you have these dependencies in your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@boxyhq/saml-jackson": "^1.34.7",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

### Running the Service
To start SAML Jackson:
```bash
npm run jackson
```

### Next Steps
1. Verify SAML Jackson is running by accessing `http://localhost:5225/api/v1/health`
2. Configure SSO settings in the application
3. Test SSO login flow with mock IdP

### Next Steps
1. Remove existing auth components and routes
2. Verify BoxyHQ stack components from documentation
3. Configure BoxyHQ components using mock data
4. Customize UI and content

   - Added missing dependencies

2. Authentication Components
   - Replaced DaisyUI components with Tailwind classes
   - Updated button components for consistent styling

3. Environment Configuration
   - Added necessary BoxyHQ environment variables

### Phase 3.1: Webhook Form Type Fixes

#### 1. UI Component Type Improvements
1. Added error handling to UI components:
   ```typescript
   // Input component error prop
   export interface InputProps extends React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> {
     error?: string;
   }

   // Textarea component error prop
   export interface TextareaProps extends React.TextareaHTMLAttributes<HTMLTextAreaElement> {
     error?: string;
   }
   ```

2. Updated component styling:
   - Added red border for validation errors
   - Added error message display below input
   - Improved focus states and transitions

#### 2. Webhook Service Updates
1. Added team-specific webhook methods:
   ```typescript
   // Find webhooks by team
   async findByTeam(teamId: string): Promise<Array<Webhook & { name: string }>> {
     const webhooks = await prisma.webhook.findMany({
       where: { teamId },
     });
     return webhooks.map(webhook => ({
       ...webhook,
       name: webhook.description || webhook.url,
     }));
   }

   // Create webhook with proper types
   async create(data: {
     name: string;
     url: string;
     description?: string;
     events: string[];
     isActive: boolean;
     teamId: string;
   }): Promise<Webhook>
   ```

#### 3. Webhook Page Type Safety
1. Improved type definitions:
   ```typescript
   interface WebhookWithName extends Webhook {
     name: string;
   }

   interface WebhooksPageProps {
     webhooks: WebhookWithName[];
     teamId: string;
   }
   ```

2. Fixed state management:
   - Changed `null` to `undefined` for selected webhook
   - Added proper type for webhook array state
   - Improved form submission type safety

#### 4. Common Type Issues & Solutions
1. UI Component Props:
   - Always extend React's HTML attribute interfaces
   - Add custom props with optional marker (?) when appropriate
   - Use proper event types for handlers

2. Form State:
   - Prefer `undefined` over `null` for optional values
   - Use interface extension for adding computed fields
   - Ensure proper typing for form values and handlers

3. API Integration:
   - Define request/response types explicitly
   - Use proper type narrowing with type guards
   - Handle computed fields at the service layer

#### 5. Testing & Validation
1. Run type checks:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

2. Common type errors to watch for:
   - Incompatible null/undefined assignments
   - Missing props in component interfaces
   - Incorrect event handler types
   - Type mismatches in API responses
