const jackson = require('@boxyhq/saml-jackson');

async function startServer() {
  const app = express();
  const port = 5225;

  const config = {
    externalUrl: process.env.BOXYHQ_SAML_JACKSON_URL || 'http://localhost:5225',
    samlPath: '/api/v1/saml',
    db: {
      engine: 'sql',
      type: 'postgres',
      url: process.env.SAML_DATABASE_URL || 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/blueprint_club_saml?schema=public',
    },
    saml: {
      callback: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/boxyhq-saml',
    },
    oidc: {
      clientSecretVerifier: process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_VERIFIER,
    },
    apiKey: process.env.SAML_ADMIN_API_KEY,
  };

  try {
    const jacksonInstance = await jackson.default(config);
    app.use('/', jacksonInstance);

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`SAML Jackson service started on port ${port}`);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to start SAML Jackson:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

startServer();
```

### Key Configuration Notes

## SAML Jackson Integration Troubleshooting (Dec 22, 2024)

### Issue
SAML Jackson service was not starting properly on port 5225, resulting in a 404 error when accessing the service.

### Investigation Steps
1. Initial state:
   - SAML Jackson package (@boxyhq/saml-jackson@1.34.7) installed
   - Service not starting with default configuration

2. Environment Configuration:
   ```env
   BOXYHQ_SAML_JACKSON_URL=http://localhost:5225
   BOXYHQ_ENTERPRISE_SLUG=blueprint-club
   BOXYHQ_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@blueprintclub.com
   SAML_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/blueprint_club_saml?schema=public
   SAML_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@blueprintclub.com
   SAML_ADMIN_API_KEY=your-admin-api-key
   ```

3. Attempted Solutions:
   - Tried running SAML Jackson directly using npx
   - Attempted global installation
   - Created custom script to initialize SAML Jackson

### Solution
Created a dedicated script (`scripts/jackson.js`) to properly initialize SAML Jackson:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const jackson = require('@boxyhq/saml-jackson');

async function startServer() {
  const app = express();
  const port = 5225;

  const config = {
    externalUrl: process.env.BOXYHQ_SAML_JACKSON_URL || 'http://localhost:5225',
    samlPath: '/api/v1/saml',
    db: {
      engine: 'sql',
      type: 'postgres',
      url: process.env.SAML_DATABASE_URL || 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/blueprint_club_saml?schema=public',
    },
    saml: {
      callback: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/boxyhq-saml',
    },
    oidc: {
      clientSecretVerifier: process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_VERIFIER,
    },
    apiKey: process.env.SAML_ADMIN_API_KEY,
  };

  try {
    const jacksonInstance = await jackson.default(config);
    app.use('/', jacksonInstance);

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`SAML Jackson service started on port ${port}`);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to start SAML Jackson:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

startServer();
```

Updated `package.json` script:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "jackson": "node scripts/jackson.js"
  }
}
```

### Running the Service
To start SAML Jackson:
```bash
npm run jackson

2. Configure SSO settings in the application
3. Test SSO login flow with mock IdP

### Next Steps
1. Remove existing auth components and routes
