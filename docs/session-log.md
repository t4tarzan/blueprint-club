# Development Session Log

## Session: 2024-12-24

### Completed Tasks
1. **Documentation Structure**
   - Created implementation-ver3.md for development guidelines
   - Created api-integration.md for API documentation
   - Updated architecture.md with dependency layers
   - Organized development phases

2. **Architecture Planning**
   - Defined three-layer dependency architecture
   - Mapped features to dependencies
   - Created implementation timeline
   - Established cost control strategy

3. **Documentation Created/Updated**
   - `/docs/implementation-ver3.md`: Development guidelines
   - `/docs/api-integration.md`: API documentation & monitoring
   - `/docs/architecture.md`: System architecture & phases
   - `/docs/structured.md`: Core features
   - `/docs/structured-part2.md`: Advanced features

### Current Status
1. **Documentation Ready**
   - Core architecture defined
   - Development phases planned
   - API integration guide created
   - Monitoring strategy established

2. **Development Setup**
   - Core dependencies identified
   - Service layer mapped
   - Feature-specific requirements documented
   - Cost control measures defined

### Next Steps
1. **Phase 1: Foundation (4-6 weeks)**
   - Begin with core infrastructure setup
   - Focus on authentication system
   - Implement database schema
   - Set up monitoring

2. **Development Priorities**
   - Start with Core Layer dependencies
   - Implement authentication services
   - Set up database and caching
   - Create basic API structure

3. **Documentation Needs**
   - Create database schema documentation
   - Set up API endpoint documentation
   - Begin integration-log.md entries
   - Start tracking in errors.log

### Reference Files
1. **Core Documentation**
   - `architecture.md`: System design & phases
   - `implementation-ver3.md`: Development guidelines
   - `api-integration.md`: API & monitoring
   - `structured.md` & `structured-part2.md`: Features

2. **Tracking Files**
   - `integration-log.md`: Integration progress
   - `errors.log`: Issue tracking
   - `session-log.md`: Development progress

### Important Notes
1. **Development Approach**
   - Follow layered dependency architecture
   - Implement features phase by phase
   - Maintain documentation as we progress
   - Focus on core infrastructure first

2. **Key Considerations**
   - Start with free tiers for services
   - Use mock data for testing
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Document all integration issues

### Next Session Goals
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation:
   - Set up Next.js project
   - Configure TypeScript
   - Initialize database
   - Set up authentication

2. Documentation to maintain:
   - Update integration-log.md as we progress
   - Document errors in errors.log
   - Keep session-log.md current
   - Update API documentation as needed

## Session End: 2024-12-24 16:51

### Ready for Next Session
- All documentation cross-linked
- Implementation phases defined
- Development timeline set
- Error tracking ready
- Architecture documented

Next session will begin with Phase 1 implementation starting with core infrastructure setup.
