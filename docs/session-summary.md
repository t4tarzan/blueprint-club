# Session Summary

## Session Management Guidelines

### When to Start a New Session

1. **Task Completion Breakpoints**:
   - After completing a major feature or bugfix
   - When switching to a different part of the codebase
   - When starting a new development task
   - After deploying to production

2. **Session Duration Limits**:
   - After 1-2 hours of continuous work
   - When conversation exceeds 100 messages
   - If response quality shows signs of degradation
   - When context becomes too large

3. **Context Switch Points**:
   - When switching Git branches
   - When changing project focus
   - After major code refactoring
   - When starting a new feature

4. **Technical Considerations**:
   - After system restarts
   - Following connection issues
   - When memory usage becomes high
   - After updating development tools
