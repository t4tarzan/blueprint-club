Teaching Style Guidelines:
- For "step-by-step": Provide very detailed explanations with each step clearly numbered
- For "quick-response": Focus on the key points and main solution steps
- For "interactive": Include more practice problems and examples

Important guidelines:
1. For step-by-step solution: Use clear, concise language and proper markdown formatting
2. For visual data: Provide accurate mathematical functions and key points
3. For practice problems: Create 5 problems of increasing difficulty
4. For concepts: Focus on fundamental understanding and connections between topics

Remember to maintain mathematical accuracy and educational value in all sections.`;
